## Project 3 - Layoff 


## Topic Overview


Over the last two years, the world economy has undergone significant changes, largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate its impact.
The pandemic caused widespread disruption across many industries, with some experiencing significant declines in demand and others seeing increased demand due to changes in consumer behavior. Governments and central banks responded with a range of policies aimed at supporting individuals and businesses, stabilizing financial markets, and stimulating economic growth.

## Creating the Dashboard

Created a dashboard showing three visualizations we created: using Java Script's D3 library and created line chart and bar chart, used Leaflet and created a map. We created filters on the left side of the dashboard, the filters allow user to filter the data by industry and country, which reflects on the leaflet map and line chart.
